A dashboard where you can see the price of Bitcoin in the main exchanges. These are:
1 - Binance
2 - FTX
3 - KuCoin
4 - BitStamp
5 - BitFinex
6 - Kraken
7 - Coinbase

Built using Gspread, Python, Telegram, Telebot, and each exchange API.

## How does it work? ‚ùî
First, you have the price for each BTC pair in each exchange, and then this prices are pasted in a google sheet in order to be able to use in a webpage, or a dashboard.
